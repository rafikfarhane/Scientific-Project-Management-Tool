# Scientific-Project-Management-Tool
A central tool for managing scientific projects that enables researchers to book resources, manage team members, and efficiently organize projectsâ€”all within a user-friendly platform.
## Main Features

### 1. Project Management
- Create and manage projects (title, description, contributors, funding status)
- Archive and delete completed projects

### 2. Permission Management
- Add and remove contributors with different permission levels (Read/Write/Admin)
- Control access to resources

### 3. Resource Management (in development)
